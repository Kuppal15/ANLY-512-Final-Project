# ANLY-512-Final-Project: Predicting Airbnb Rental Prices using Statistical Learning: A Data-Driven Approach

The Airbnb dataset utilized in this project was created by collecting quarterly updates throughout the year 2022, in a seasonal manner. The data was gathered on specific dates, namely March 16th, June 8th, September 12th, and December 15th, and each update captured new listings, changes to existing listings, and bookings that occurred during the previous quarter. This approach provides a comprehensive and dynamic source of data for statistical learning projects, as it enables the analysis of how the Airbnb market evolves over time and allows for the identification of trends that may be missed by looking at a single snapshot of the data.


This repository contains the codes and outputs generated by Team 27 for the ANLY512 Project. The following questions are what we aim to answer during our research:
- What machine learning models most accurately predict price? How do the modelsâ€™ accuracy vary between them?
- What are the significant variables within the Airbnb Dataset in relation to price?
- Are ensemble methods or regression models superior in predicting specific variables?
